# New Zealand MIQ (Managed Isolation and Quarantine) Tools

These tools were designed to make it easier to book a spot in New Zealand Managed Isolation and Quarantine. This should mainly help you save your precious time and not have to manually refresh the website until you find one of the rare spots.

**HELP OTHERS:**  
These tools will give you an advantage in booking a spot on New Zealand MIQ over other people not using tools like this one. Please keep in mind that your advantage in using this tool will make it harder for others, not using a helper tool, to get a spot. Please help others to get started with these tools, so everyone gets an equal chance. 

There are several media reports on the existence of multiple similar tools, but when these tools were created, none of them seemed to be published publicly. Hopefully, by publishing, it's going to be fairer for everyone. 

Of course, hopefully, MIQ changes their website and implements a queue. Then these scripts would become obsolete, and no one will have to bother with this.

## Disclaimer

Before using this software, make sure you are not violating the terms of service of the MIQ website. And know you are using this software at your own risk. 

## MIQ Booking Assistance

*This is the recommended way for most people. No coding skills required.*

**Features**  
This script/app opens a browser window and continuously refreshes the ‘Secure your allocation’ page and beeps when new dates become available. It prefills the form to save precious seconds when trying to book a spot. All manual input required is to select the available date, tick the reCAPTCHA and click ‘Next’ to secure your spot.

## MIQ Alert

*This is a different approach. It doesn't offer as many features and is therefore not used by as many people. No coding skills required.*

**Features**  
This is a Chrome browser extension that continuously refreshes the MIQ portal home page and beeps when new dates become available.

## FAQ

> I'm lost. / I have another question not answered here yet.

If you have questions, feel free to use the `Issues` section (select at the top of this page). Asking publicly will help others with a similar question and you might get help from more people.

> I’m getting a `502 Bad Gateway`, `404` or `403 Forbidden` Error. What should I do? 

This wil happen after the website has refreshed many times. Please wait 5-10 minutes and reactivate the script/app.

> How much time do I have to book a spot?

It seems less that currently, less than 3 seconds. This might vary though.

> After I click next, the page refreshes and nothing happens.

This means that unfortunately, someone was quicker than you to secure the date.

> The alert sounds but I don't see a date selected in tha calendar.

Don't worry, the app will input the date without having to change the calendar UI. You can proceed to complete the reCAPTCHA and click next as soon as you hear the beep.

## Contributions

These tools are only a quick attempt to create some remedy. They are by far, not finished or perfect. Also, in case MIQ changes their website, they might break any time too.

Please use the issue section to help each other using this or discuss improvements. Of course, pull requests are welcome too.

_If anyone would like to create a screencast video with a walkthrough, I will be very happy to add it to this document._

## Donate

Found this software useful and want to pay it forward? Please consider donating to **Code Club Aotearoa**. 

> Code Club is a nationwide network of free volunteer-led coding clubs for Kiwi kids.

Their mission is: 

> To give every kiwi kid the opportunity to learn to code, no matter who or where they are.

Code Club Aotearoa is "encouraging children to combine their imaginations with an understanding of programming" with "diversity and inclusivity" as core values. 

These MIQ Booking tools are aiming at fairer access to MIQ spots with freely available open-source software. However, no matter how well designed services (like the MIQ booking website) or developed digital tools (like this one) are, their accessibility is based on technology skills that are unfortunately not distributed equally across society. The work of organizations like Code Club Aotearoa will help to make this knowledge gap smaller.
